                Established in 1972, the Department of Public Administration is one of the leading Departments in the
                University with remarkable academic research and administrative excellence. The dynamic leadership 
                of its founding chairman Professor Nur Mohammad Miah and the efforts of other faculty members 
                enormously helped the department to attain the present stage. Since its establishment, the department 
                has been conducting undergraduate and postgraduate academic programs and offering BSS (Honours),
                MSS, MPhil and PhD degrees.
                <br/><br/>

                The four years BSS and one year MSS programs of the department have strong theoretical and 
                quantitative orientation. All students are required to take the core courses like Introduction to 
                Public Administration, Public Management, Personnel and Human Resources Management, Financial Administration, Comparative Public Administration, 
                Sociology of Administration, Organizational Behavior, Development Administration, etc. Beyond these, there are several applied courses such as Statistics and 
                Research in Administration, Computer Application, Project Management, Administrative Systems Analysis and Public Policy Analysis. Since 2006-2007 session 
                the department has been following the semester system in conducting the courses and taking the examinations.
                <br/><br/>


                The Department of Public Administration along with quality teaching and research at the University level, also plays important role both in policy making and 
                running government administrative system at national level. A large number of former students of the department are now holding higher positions in Bangladesh 
                civil service and other national and multinational organizations.
                <br/><br/>

                The department conducts collaborative research and training programs with other international universities and agencies. During 1994-1997 it conducted an
                extensive research on decentralization and local level democracy with the Bergen University, Norway. Recently, the Department and the UNICEF Regional Office 
                in Kathmandu, Nepal signed a collaborative agreement to launch an Executive Level Short Course on Project Monitoring and Evaluation. The department has a 
                strong professional linkage with the government and administration.
